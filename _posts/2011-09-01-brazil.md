In a collaboration with Saulo Freitas from INPE on a FAPESP grant, I intended a prescribed fire in Acre, Brazil in September 2011.This burnt was organized on the experimental site of EMBRAPA in Rio Branco.

The video shows synchronized visible (left) and Middle Infra Red (MIR; right) cameras operated from a helicopter hovering above the plot. The helicopter was courteously provided by the police department of Acre.

The video is accelerated 4 times. The acquisition rate of the MIR camera was 0.33Hz while the visible operated at 25Hz. This difference explains the time-lapse effect on the temperature map.
